# Restore Protein Structure Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for restoring and refining protein structures in **PDB format**. The pipeline follows a three-step process:

1. **Add missing heavy atoms** using [PDBFixer](https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer).
2. **Optimize side-chain conformations** using [SCWRL4](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/scwrl4/).
3. **Merge atomic coordinates** from the original, fixed, and optimized structures while preserving **beta-factor information**.

This tool is designed for **structural bioinformatics** applications, enabling researchers to reconstruct high-quality protein models from incomplete structures.

## Features

- **Automated heavy atom reconstruction** for incomplete PDB files.
- **Parallel processing** for high throughput.
- **Side-chain optimization** with SCWRL4.
- **Preservation of atomic beta-factors** during reconstruction.
- **Detailed logging and statistical reports** for quality assessment.

## Dependencies

### Required Python Packages

- **Python 3.x**
- **PDBFixer (v1.10.0)**
- **OpenMM (v8.2.0)**
- **NumPy (v2.2.0rc1)**
